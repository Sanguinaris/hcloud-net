if you feel a feature is missing, add it :D (or create an issue)

Whilest writing code, make sure to: 
* Sprinkle some tests in
* try to follow the general coding scheme
* Documentaion, Documentation, Documentation
* I try to have this at 100% Code Coverage, you should leave it at that

if you are unsure whether or not your code is up to standard with the above, just create a pull request and i'll complain (or not) about it
